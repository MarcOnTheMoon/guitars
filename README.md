# Hexaphonic Guitar and Signal Analysis
Development of hexaphonic pickup and signal analysis software

## Achievements so far
- [X] _Hardware_: design of a hexaphonic pickup (including  coil winding machine, 3D prints, and PCB)
- [X] _Signal chain_: simple chain from hexaphonic guitar to signal analysis in a laptop
- [X] _Pitch detection_: proof of concept for MIDI convertion of guitar signals

This is a good foundation. Now there are lots and lots to further topics to work on in detail.

## Contributors
The activities done so far and hopefully still to come are collaborations of myself and my magnificent students of our [Department at HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/hochschule/technik-und-informatik/departments/informations-und-elektrotechnik/studium/studiengaenge/). Let me express my gratitude for your contributions and list all involved people in alphabetical order:

- Marc Hensel (design of hexaphonic pickup and coil winder)
- Fiona Vogel (theses: hexaphonic guitar, MIDI)

## Supporters
My deepest thanks go to [No.1 Guitar Center, Hamburg](https://www.no1-guitars.de/). Sharing the same passion for music, they did not hesitate to support our work not only by kind words, but also by an USB audio interface offering inputs to the six coils of our hexaphonic pickups. Without this valuable support, we could not have done our work as intended.
